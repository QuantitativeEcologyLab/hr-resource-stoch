# Abstract

\noindent The amount of space animals use is thought to be tightly linked to the availability of resources within their habitats, such that animals living in productive habitats generally require less space than those in resource-poor habitats. This hypothesis has widespread empirical support, but existing studies have focused primarily on responses to the *mean* amount of resources, while responses to the variance around the mean are still largely unknown. This is not a trivial oversight. Animals adjust to variable environmental conditions, so failing to account for the effects of resource unpredictability can result in a limited understanding of animals' spatial needs, challenging ecological theory and applied conservation alike. In this study, we first review the literature of studies that estimate animals' spatial needs as a function of resource abundance. We then leverage this information to provide a unifying framework and hypotheses for the effect of mean *and* variance in resources on animals' space use. Next, we use simulated movement data to demonstrate how the combined effects of mean and variance in resource abundance interact to shape predictable patterns in animal space use. Finally, we use real-world tracking data on a lowland tapir (*Tapirus terrestris*) from the Brazilian Cerrado <!--an impala (*Aepyceros melampus*), and multiple moose (*Alces alces*)--> to show how this framework can be applied to better understand the movement ecology of free-ranging animals. Results from the simulations and empirical examples are presented using a fully transparent approach that allows researchers to apply the framework to their own data and inform area-based conservation efforts.

# Introduction

\noindent The amount of resources an organism is able to access is a strong determinant of its odds of survival and reproduction. Resource limitations can cause individuals to experience a negative energetic balance, which can then result in lower fitness [@hou_cold_2020; @le_bot_fishery_2019], altered physiology [@dai_pra_ground_2022; @rocha_life_2021; @le_bot_fishery_2019; @wessling_seasonal_2018], lower chance of reproduction [@stefanescu_timing_2021; @schmidt_interplay_2020; @le_bot_fishery_2019; @douglas_relative_2014], and even death [@foley_severe_2008; @berger_climate_2018], along with changes to community structure [@haney_tipping_2018; @burson_competition_2018; @riotte-lambert_environmental_2020; @ghislandi_resource_2018]. Thus, many organisms will adapt their behaviors in response to changes in local resource abundance to ensure their needs are met. Some species may respond to fluctuations in resource abundance by, if possible, switching to other food sources [@steinmetz_effects_2021; @le_bot_fishery_2019], reducing energetic costs by lowering body heat [@schmidt_interplay_2020], or entering hibernation or torpor [@fjelldal_nightly_2021; @mohr_cellular_2020; @boyles_optimal_2020]. However, movement represents one of the most readily available behaviors that species can adjust, whether this be by modifying their home range [@bista_effect_2022; @bradsworth_using_2022; @lucherini_habitat_1996; @relyea_home_2000; @yu_artificial_2022; @arechavala-lopez_common_2019], migrating [@middleton_green-wave_2018; @geremia_migrating_2019], moving nomadically [@teitelbaum_beyond_2019; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019], or dispersing [framework: @southwood_habitat_1977; amphibians: @cayuela_determinants_2020; birds: @pretorius_movement_2020; @wheat_migrate_2017; mammals: @singh_migration_2012].

The relationship between animal movement and resource abundance has been of interest to biologists for over half a century. @burt_territoriality_1943 considered the search for food as the primary driver for animal movement within an animal's home range. Three decades after, @southwood_habitat_1977 suggested that change in resource abundance is a strong determinant of how animals decide where to live and when to reproduce. Two years later, @harestad_home_1979 proposed that the simplest relationship between resource abundance and an animal's home-range size is

\begin{equation}
H = C / R,
(\#eq:harestad-eq)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $H$ is the animal's **home-range size**, $C$ is the animal's resource consumption, and $R$ is the **resources** the animal can access. Harestad and Bunnel's model is simple to conceptualize and allows for testable predictions, but a species' spatial requirements likely depend on numerous other factors, such as competition, metabolic rate, diet, and body weight [@harvey_primate_1981; @lindstedt_home_1986; @reiss_scaling_1988; @harvey_primate_1981; @gittleman_carnivore_1982; @jetz_scaling_2004; @boratynski_energetic_2020; @noonan_effects_2020]. While many researchers have since demonstrated that animals adapt their home ranges in response to resources abundance, few studies build upon others' previous work. Instead, results are reported as independent, novel findings. Consequently, we currently lack a unifying framework for quantifying the effects of resource abundance on animals' spatial needs. In addition, while much work has been done on estimating animals' responses to average resource abundance, there is little information on how they respond to unpredictable changes in resources.

In this paper, we refer to a location's average amount of resources as **resource abundance**, while we use the phrase **resource stochasticity** to indicate the variability in resource abundance due to unpredictable causes. We argue that, on its own, a habitat's long-term resource abundance is not sufficient to assess the habitat's quality, nor make predictions about how much space an animal might use. For instance, a grassland with relatively low but constant forage availability will require drastically different behaviors and adaptations from a desert location with equally scarce forage but rare, sudden, and strong pulses of resources. In the grassland, an animal may require a large but constant home range as it moves between locations in search of food [*sensu* @teitelbaum_beyond_2019], while an animal in the desert may switch between dispersal as it searches for high-resource patches and short-term range residency until the local resources are depleted. Although it may be possible for both habitats to have the same long-term average resource abundance, the differences in resource unpredictability result in substantially different movement and life history strategies being selected for. Although it is generally expected that resource unpredictability will decrease animals' fitness and a landscape's energetic balance [@chevin_adaptation_2010], there is little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis [but see: @herfindal_prey_2005; @nilsen_can_2005; @rizzuto_forage_2021].

Here, we illustrate how animals' spatial needs depend on both the abundance and unpredictability of resources. First, we set the theoretical background necessary for the successive sections by introducing key concepts and notation. Next, we provide a review of the effects of resource *abundance* on animals' spatial needs while suggesting a unifying hypothesis. Afterwards, we provide a review of the effects of resource *stochasticity* on animals' spatial needs while suggesting a second unifying hypothesis. Subsequently, we demonstrate the power of these two hypotheses using quantitative, simulated responses to changes in resource abundance and unpredictability. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework can be used in practice to describe the movement ecology of a lowland tapir (*Tapirus terrestris*) from the Brazilian Cerrado [@medici_movement_2022]. Results from the simulations and empirical example are presented using a fully transparent approach that allows researchers to replicate the work and apply the methods to their own tracking data.

# Concepts and definitions

<!--\noindent In this section, we presents the foundational concepts and terms used in this manuscript. We introduce each concept without assuming a statistical or quantitative background to maximize accessibility and minimize misunderstandings and misinterpretations.-->

## Resources as a random variable

\noindent In statistics, **random variables** indicate random (i.e., unknown) quantities and are indicated with capital letters (e.g., $R$). Known values, such as realizations of random variables (i.e., known observations or instances), are indicated with lower-case letters (e.g., $r$). Using this notation, we can write the statement "the probability of random variable $R$ taking the value $r$" as $P(R = r)$. Resource abundance is often unpredictable (and difficult to quantify), since it depends on various factors which cannot be accounted for easily, including climate [@lindstedt_seasonality_1985; @schmidt_interplay_2020; @morellet_seasonality_2013], weather [@fjelldal_nightly_2021; @morellet_seasonality_2013], competitive pressure [@torrez-herrera_monkeys_2020; @rich_anthropogenic_2012], and differences in energetics at the individual [@schmidt_interplay_2020] and species level [@jetz_scaling_2004]. Thus, we can let the random variable $R$ indicate the resource abundance at a given point in space and time. Quantifying resources as a numerical random variable, as opposed to using *ad hoc* qualitative descriptions, provides us with the capacity to leverage techniques from probability theory and statistics.

### Probability distributions

\noindent Random variables are defined by specifying the **distribution** the variable is assumed to follow (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson, Bernoulli). Since the variable is random, it can take multiple possible values, each with different probabilities. The set or range of values which have non-zero probabilities in a distribution is referred to as the distribution's **support**.

There are many distributions we can assign to $R$ depending on how we quantify it. For instance, if we measure $R$ using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [**NDVI**, see @pettorelli_normalized_2011], we should use a distribution with support over the interval $[-1, 1]$, since NDVI can only take on values between -1 and 1 (extremes included). However, there is no commonly used distribution with that support, so the best option is to rescale NDVI to (0, 1) and use a beta distribution (see the section below on applying this framework). Alternatively, if $R$ is the number of calories an animal is able to access from food in a given location, we can let $R$ follow a distribution with support positive real numbers, such as a Gamma or log-normal distribution. If $R$ is a discrete integer variable, such as the number of prey in a location during a period of time, we can use a Poisson or negative binomial distribution.

### Expected resource abundance, $\e(R)$

\noindent Since the exact value of $R$ at a given time and location is unknown, comparing the magnitude in $R$ between two locations or time periods requires a quantitative measure of what value we believe $R$ will take, on average. The **expectation** of a random variable is the value one can *expect* the random variable to take, on average, in the long term. Thus, we can let $\e(R)$ indicate the expectation of the random variable $R$. When the mean changes over time, such as in strongly seasonal regions, we explicitly indicate that $\e(R)$ changes over time by writing $\e(R)$ as a function of time, $t$: $\e(R|t) = \mu(t)$. We indicate the *estimated* average resource abundance over time by adding a caret on the symbol: $\hat \mu(t)$.

### Variance in resource abundance, $\var(R)$

\noindent In viewing resources as a random variable, we not only obtain a formal framework for describing $\e(R)$, but also the spread around $\e(R)$. A random variable's **variance** is a measure of its unpredictability (i.e., variability). We use the notation $\var(R)$ to indicate the variance in $R$ after accounting for changes in $\mu(t)$, and we use $\sigma^2(t)$ to indicate its function over time (with estimate $\widehat{\sigma^2}(t)$). Consequently, while $R$ may vary within years, we define $\var(R)$ as the variation in $R$ after accounting for the fact that $R$ is (predictably) lower during some seasons and higher in others. Additionally, we distinguish between two different sources of variation. We refer to known or expected spatiotemporal differences or changes as **heterogeneity**, which we consider as a change in $\mu(t)$. In contrast, we use the term **stochasticity** for unpredictable and unexpected variation (i.e., due to $\sigma^2(t)$. For example, the location of (high-yield) berry bushes in a valley and the time at which they produce fruit may be heterogeneous, but it becomes predictable once a bear visits all patches in the valley. In contrast, whether next year will be a good or bad year for berries is stochastic because it depends on factors the bear cannot predict.

### Simulating resource abundance

\noindent In this paper, we simulate $R$ using a Gamma distribution with time-dependent mean $\mu(t)$ and time-dependent variance $\sigma^2(t)$, which we write as $R \sim \Gamma\big(\mu(t), \sigma^2(t)\big)$. Although Gamma distributions are more often parameterized using parameters shape and scale ($k > 0$ and $\theta > 0$) or shape and rate ($\alpha > 0$ and $\beta = 1/\theta > 0$), we use $\e(R) = k \theta$ and $\var(R) = k \theta^2$ to facilitate visualizing the simulations. However, note that $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ are not independent because the variance depends strongly on the mean (and vice-versa). As the mean approaches zero (from the positive side, which we write as $\e(R) \rightarrow0^+$) the variance also does: $\e(R) \rightarrow 0^+ \iff k \theta \rightarrow 0^+ \iff k \theta^2 = 0^+ \iff \var(R) = 0^+$. This assumption also holds biologically; in the example from above, a mean of zero kg of berries within the bear's habitat during winter implies the variance in berries is also zero.

\noindent While animals' needs vary greatly between taxonomic groups, some needs are essential for most species for survival and reproduction. All heterotrophic organisms require sources of chemical energy (i.e., food), water, and various limiting nutrients to survive, grow, and reproduce [@harvey_primate_1981; @baldwin_nutritional_1984; @reich_body_2001]. Failing to acquire sufficient resources can result in lower fitness, behavioral changes, physiological changes or damage, inability to reproduce, and death. Motile organisms can move to new locations in search of resources, but they must also account for a higher metabolism and movement costs [@taylor_energetics_1982]. The hypothesis that spatial needs decrease with resource abundance, $\e(R)$, is commonly accepted and well supported, but many studies assume a linear relationship [e.g., @harestad_home_1979; @relyea_home_2000; @rizzuto_forage_2021; @bista_effect_2022; @bradsworth_using_2022; @mcclintic_effects_2014]. This is problematic because a linear relationship can lead to questionable estimates and problematic biases, such as negative or excessively small home ranges [e.g., figure 2 in the work of @bista_effect_2022]. Conceptually, the relationship between spatial needs and $\e(R)$ must be nonlinear, since there are limits to how much space an animal is able to explore in its lifetime as well as the minimum amount of space it requires to survive [which is necessarily greater than zero -- see figure \@ref(fig:mu-hyp) as well as: @lucherini_habitat_1996; @herfindal_prey_2005; @nilsen_can_2005; @simcharoen_female_2014; @watson_ferruginous_2020; and contrast them to estimates based on linear models, e.g.: @relyea_home_2000; @rizzuto_forage_2021; @bista_effect_2022].

When $\e(R)$ is high, we expect animals' spatial requirements to be relatively small and near the smallest amount of space required to survive [e.g., @relyea_home_2000; @nilsen_can_2005; @herfindal_prey_2005]. However, as $\e(R)$ decreases, we expect animals' spatial requirements to increase nonlinearly, since low values of $\e(R)$ force animals to expand their home ranges [@lucherini_habitat_1996; @relyea_home_2000; @nilsen_can_2005; @herfindal_prey_2005; @bista_effect_2022], migrate to better locations [@samarra_movements_2017; @middleton_green-wave_2018; @geremia_migrating_2019], or move nomadically [@singh_migration_2012; @polansky_elucidating_2015; @teitelbaum_beyond_2019; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019]. It is unclear when animals switch from range residency to migration or nomadism (or vice-versa), but understanding the connection between these types of movement is important for quantifying the effect of resource abundance on animal's spatial needs and when an animal may choose to migrate or disperse rather than remaining range-resident [mammals: @teitelbaum_how_2015; moose, *Alces alces*: @singh_migration_2012; eagles, *Haliaeetus leucocephalus*: @wheat_migrate_2017; @poessel_interpreting_2022; lesser flamingos, *Phoeniconaias minor*: @pretorius_movement_2020]. Still, large-scale changes in movement behavior (such as species-wide shifts to dispersal, migration, or nomadism) are more likely to occur over evolutionary timescales than over an animal's lifespan. For instance, larger home ranges requires greater vagility, which, in turn, is facilitated by morphological features such as hinged joints and elongated limbs [@jetz_scaling_2004; @hirt_general_2017; @andersson_elbow-joint_2004; @samuels_postcranial_2013].

It is also worth noting that high $\e(R)$ does not does not necessarily imply that organisms have access to high amounts of resources, as predator avoidance and competition within an organism's habitat will decrease the proportion of $R$ it is able to access. Thus, organisms in habitats with strong competitive pressure and predation may require larger home ranges [@jetz_scaling_2004; @prox_framework_2020], but larger home ranges can be harder to defend and also result in higher rates of competition and movement costs [@grant_whether_1993; @jetz_scaling_2004; but also see @dickie_resource_2022]. Additionally, persistent territorial defense from competitors may prevent organisms from using space freely and as necessary [wolves, *Canis lupus*: @rich_anthropogenic_2012; feral cats, *Felis catus*: @bengsen_feral_2016; Capuchin monkeys, *Cebus capucinus*: @torrez-herrera_monkeys_2020], so the effect of $\e(R)$ on space use may vary between individuals, species, and locations. Still, these pressures simply alter the intensity with which organisms respond to $\e(R)$ but not the shape of the relationship, since each of these cases fall along different parts of the continuum in $\e(R)$ shown in figure \@ref(fig:mu-hyp).

```{r multipanel-constant-var, fig.cap="Fictitious example of variation in resources in a heterogeneous environment with constant variance (after accounting for changes in the mean). (a.) Resources ($R$, brown-green fill) vary over time and space with a constant the variance (dot color). (b.) Arbitrary definition of $R$ as following a Gamma distribution with time-varying mean $\\mu(t)$ and constant variance $\\var(R) = \\sigma^2$.

knitr::include_graphics('../figures/habitat-examples-constant-variance.png')
```

Consider the scenario where the average in resource abundance, $\e(R)$, changes over time but $\var(R) = \sigma^2 > 0$ is constant over time and space (see figure \@ref(fig:multipanel-constant-var)a). We can use the notation $R \sim \Gamma\big(\mu(t), \sigma^2\big)$ to indicate that $R$ follows a Gamma distribution with a mean $\mu(t)$ that changes over time (i.e., it is a function of time) while the variance is constant (figure \@ref(fig:multipanel-constant-var)b). Since $R$ is spatiotemporally random, an animal that moves in the landscape will not find the same $R$ at different time points or throughout the habitat. However, if $\mu(t)$ changes repetitively and regularly over time (e.g. peaks each spring and is lowest in winter), an animal may learn to predict times of high or low $R$ [e.g., @falcon-cortes_hierarchical_2021; @geremia_migrating_2019; @abrahms_memory_2019; @samarra_movements_2017], but it will not be able to predict *where* $R$ is high if $\e(R)$ does not vary predictably over space.

This model is somewhat simplistic, but its simplicity makes it easy to fit and conceptualize. Such a model may be appropriate in regions where variability does not change noticeably spatiotemporally, or when data availability is too low to produce appreciable measures of changes in variance. Examples of temporally homogeneous habitats include regions where productivity remains fairly predictable throughout the year (e.g., equatorial rain forests or highly homogeneous deserts). When productivity is approximately stable over long periods of time, it may be possible to further simplify the model by assuming a constant mean, but this is likely rarely the case. Most often, $\e(R)$ will vary over time, and animals' behaviors will change in response.

# Effects of resource stochasticity, $\var(R)$

\noindent Although the effect of $R$ on animals' spatial needs is often recognized and accounted for in ecology [@burt_territoriality_1943; @southwood_habitat_1977;  @lucherini_habitat_1996; @relyea_home_2000; @nilsen_can_2005; @williams-guillen_resource_2006; @rickbeil_plasticity_2019], most of the focus has been on the effects of $\e(R)$, while $\var(R)$ has received far less attention [but see @nilsen_can_2005; @di_stefano_resource_2011; @rizzuto_forage_2021; @seigle-ferrand_systematic_2021]. However, $\var(R)$ can fluctuate both spatially and temporally due to many important drivers, including repetitive and predictable patterns as well as more stochastic ones. For example, since berries are scarce outside the growing season, the variance in berries will also be low. But during the growing season, both the average number of berries and the variance in berries are higher, since a bear may explore a location only after competitors ate all the berries. In contrast, other sources of stochasticity can be much less predictable, such as the arrival of new competitors [@alexander_novel_2015], the emergence of new diseases [@hollings_trophic_2014], droughts [@foley_severe_2008; @haig_assessment_2013], fires [@jolly_animal_2022], floods [@ramos_pereira_structure_2013], changes in climate and phenology [@berger_climate_2018; @grant_evolution_2017; @jonzen_rapid_2006; @inouye_climate_2000; @severson_spring_2021; @woolway_global_2020], and other extreme events [@logares_black_2012; @anderson_black-swan_2017].

Environmental variability can reduce a landscape's energetic balance [@chevin_adaptation_2010], which, in turn, decreases animals' fitness [@berger_climate_2018] and increases their spatial needs. While this is true for both predictable and unpredictable stochasticity, extreme and rare events are more likely to have a stronger effect. A few recent studies support these hypotheses [@chevin_adaptation_2010; @morellet_seasonality_2013; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019; @riotte-lambert_environmental_2020], but many of them are limited in geographic and taxonomic scales, so the extent to which these preliminary findings can be generalized is still very limited. Thus, there remains a need for developing a more complete understanding of how animals' spatial needs change with environmental stochasticity.

Similar to the effect of $\e(R)$, we expect $\var(R)$ to have a nonlinear effect on animals' spatial needs. When $\var(R)$ is low enough that $R$ is relatively predictable, we do not expect changes in $\var(R)$ to have a noticeable effect, but as resources become increasingly unpredictable, we expect spatial needs to increase progressively faster (figure \@ref(fig:s2-hyp)) because: (1) as $\var(R)$ increases the chances of finding low $R$ increase superlinearly, (2) stochastic environments tend to be less productive [@chevin_adaptation_2010], and (3) the added movement required to search for food increases animals' energetic requirements. If resources remain highly unpredictable over long periods of time (e.g., multiple lifespans), animals may evolve or develop new behaviors (such as nomadism, dispersal, and migration) or adaptations (such as increased fat storage or food caching). If changes in $\sigma^2(t)$ are sufficiently predictable, animals may learn to anticipate and prepare for periods of greater stochasticity by pre-preemptively caching food or migrating, or relying on alternative food sources during stochastic events (e.g., after the arrival of competitors).

Like the scenario illustrated in figure \@ref(fig:multipanel-constant-var), we can imagine an environment where both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ change over time. We can then define $\var(R)$ as a function of time using the same notation as we did for $\e(R)$, i.e., $\var(R | t) = \sigma^2(t)$ (figure \@ref(fig:multipanel-changing-var)). When both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ change over time, predicting $R$ becomes more complex. Statistically, this is because $\sigma^2(t)$ decreases as we allow $\mu(t)$ to change more over time and explain a greater proportion of $\var(R)$. Biologically, this is important because some animals may perceive changes in $R$ as a change in $\e(R)$, while others may perceive the change as a stochastic event. An animal's perception of changes in $R$ will depend strongly on the animal's cognitive capacities, including its memory and lifespan [@mueller_social_2013; @abrahms_memory_2019; @foley_severe_2008; @falcon-cortes_hierarchical_2021; @fagan_spatial_2013]. The ability to predict trends in $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ requires animals have high cognitive capacity, since distinguishing between changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var (R)$ is not easy [@steixner-kumar_strategies_2020], especially if $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ are not independent, as in the case of $R \sim \Gamma(\mu(t), \sigma^2(t))$. Regardless of whether an organism is capable of predicting changes in $\sigma^2(t)$, the effect of $\var(R)$ is arguably as important as the effect of $\e(R)$ in determining how said organism will respond to changes in $R$ and consequently adapt its space use.

# Interactive effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$

\noindent We have provided the case for why both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ affect organisms' spatial needs, but we presented the two parameters as independent drivers of movement. However, in the more realistic scenario where both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ fluctuate over time, animals may respond to changes in $\var(R)$ more when resources are scarce than when they are abundant. Consequently, models estimating the effects of $R$ on animal's movement should account for not only the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ separately, but also their interactive effects. A highly unpredictable habitat may be very inhospitable if resources are poor, but $\var(R)$ may have little effect if resources are stochastic but always abundant. Thus, we expect $\var(R)$ to have a stronger effect on spatial needs when $\e(R)$ is low, and less of an effect when $\e(R)$ is high.

<!-- Most habitats with appreciable seasonal climatic changes will require models of $R$ to account for changes in both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, as $\sigma^2(t)$ will often change within and between years, and periods of high $\mu(t)$ will often be more variable than times of lower productivity or dormancy. However, the effects of $\var(R)$ on animals' spatial needs likely vary between species, since movement capacity, and energetic and nutritional needs also vary between species [@boratynski_energetic_2020; @noonan_effects_2020]. Small-scale variations in $R$ may be sufficient to causes changes in behavior for some small animals, while animals with larger spatial needs may not even notice a change. -->

@rizzuto_forage_2021 found that the spatial needs of snowshoe hares (*Lepus americanus*) increased with average carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N, a measure of N scarcity) in lowbush blueberry as well as the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation over the mean, $\frac{\sqrt{\sigma^2(t)}}{\mu(t)}$) in C:N. However, it is hard to determine how $\sigma^2(t)$ affected the hares' spatial needs since the coefficient of variation is a function of both $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$, so the effects of the two variables are confounded. Similarly, @mueller_how_2011 suggested that ecosystem variability (measured as spatial semivariance in NDVI) causes ungulates to move more and be more likely to be nomadic, but it is hard to determine whether the higher semivariances in NDVI are due to an increase in $\var(R)$ or simply spatial changes in $\e(R)$ (e.g., increased seasonality, heterogeneity, or continentality). Likewise, @herfindal_prey_2005 found that the home ranges Canadian lynx (*Lynx canadensis*) decreased with seasonality, but this may be an artifact of a lower $\mu(t)$ in highly seasonal environments, rather than stochasticity in $R$. A subsequent analysis by @nilsen_can_2005 of the lynx data of @herfindal_prey_2005 along with data on wolverines (*Gulo gulo*), bobcats (*Lynx rufus*), and coyotes (*Canis latrans*) found that carnivores respond differently to seasonality, which suggests that different species may have different perceptions of the changes in $R$ over the seasons. Collectively, these studies provide support towards the effects of both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on animals' spatial needs, but the lack of a unifying framework across these studies makes it challenging to synthesize their findings. Thus, it is important to disentangle the effects of spatiotemporal heterogeneity (i.e., changes in $\e(R)$, such as seasonal trends in $\mu(t)$) and stochasticity ($\var(R)$). The need to account for changes in both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ is compounded by recent changes in climate, which expose species to novel situations and increasingly common and extreme stochastic events [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023; @noonan_situ_2018; @yao_emergence_2022].

@nilsen_can_2005 also show that the effect of $\e(R)$ on the home-range size of wolves and fishers (*Martes pennanti*) depends on seasonality (and vice-versa), since animals in habitats with high and low seasonality had opposite responses to $\e(R)$. Therefore, it may not be sufficient to account for the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$; models may also need a term for interaction between the two. This may be because animals respond strongly to $\sigma^2(t)$ when $\mu(t)$ is low, but they may not respond if $\mu(t)$ is sufficiently high. However, it does not explain why animals may respond to $\e(R)$ in opposite ways in different habitats. Instead, we suspect this inconsistency is because @nilsen_can_2005 do not distinguish between changes in $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ between seasons, so the effects of the two are confounded in the seasonality term. Distinguishing between changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ allows one to separate the two seasonal cycles and produce more consistent results.

## Simulating animal responses to $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$

To illustrate how $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ affect animals' spatial needs as well as the interaction effect of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, we present the results from a series of quantitative simulations in figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) (for methodological details, see Appendix 1). The top row (constant $\var(R)$) shows how spatial needs vary for different trends in $\mu(t)$ while $\var(R)$ remains constant (like in figure \@ref(fig:multipanel-constant-var)). As $\e(R)$ increases at a constant slope (linear $\mu(t)$) the spatial needs decrease nonlinearly, with larger changes when $\e(R)$ is low, until home-range size approaches the minimum size required by the animal. As described in the section on the effects of resource abundance, the nonlinear decrease is because changes in $\mu(t)$ have a larger effect when $\e(R)$ is low [e.g., @lucherini_habitat_1996; @nilsen_can_2005; @herfindal_prey_2005].

```{r 5-5-sims, fig.cap="Simulated home range sizes, $H$, of an animal living in habitats where the mean and variance in resources are constant, linearly increasing, cyclical, drifting, or erratic over time. Note how $H$ decreases nonlinearly as $\\mu(t)$ increases and increases nonlinearly as $\\sigma^2(t)$ increases. Additionally, the variance in $H$ is higher when $\\mu(t)$ is lower or $\\sigma^2(t)$ is higher, and changes in $\\sigma^2(t)$ have greater impacts when $\\mu(t)$ is low.\\newline{}Simulations were run such that animals followed the same $2^{10}=1024$ tracks at each time point starting from the location $\\langle 0, 0\\rangle$ until they reach satiety, after which they were allowed to return to $\\langle 0, 0\\rangle$ over the same amount of time required to reach satiety. The animal's movement and utilization distribution were then estimated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Foraging (OUF) model and Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE), respectively, via the $\\tt{ctmm}$ package (Fleming and Calabrese 2021) for $\\tt{R}$ (R Core Team 2022). $H$ was estimated using the UD's 0.95 quantile, but the effect is true for all quantiles since the UD was estimated via AKDE. Additional information is provided in Appendix 1.", out.width='100%'}

```

In regions where the $\mu(t)$ changes over time [e.g., seasonal changes -- see cyclical $\e(R)$ and @lai_movement_2017], animals should have access to sufficient space to fulfill their needs during periods of scarcity, whether the space available is sufficiently large year-round or it changes seasonally with the expected changes in $\mu(t)$ (e.g., winter park closures). However, estimates of spatial requirements based on estimated changes in $\mu(t)$ should be interpreted carefully, since model error and unforeseeable decreases in $\e(R)$ (such as following fires or floods) may increase animals' spatial needs suddenly and unpredictably. Thus, it is best to include a "buffer" area so the available space is larger than the estimated spatial needs. This is particularly the case in environments where resource abundance changes unpredictably (drifting $\mu(t)$), since accurate long-term estimates and predictions of $\mu(t)$ may be hard to produce, if not impossible. In cases where $\mu(t)$ is highly unpredictable, animals should have enough space to collect resources during times of greatest predicted scarcity, particularly if the changes in resource abundance occur rapidly, often, or for long periods of time (erratic $\mu(t)$).

The leftmost column of figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) (constant $\e(R)$) illustrates the effects of $\var(R)$ on the simulated spatial needs while $\e(R)$ remains constant. Overall, both mean $H$ and the variance around it increase with $\sigma^2(t)$ (most visible with constant $\e(R)$ and linear $\var(R)$). This is because, similarly to resource-poor periods, times of greater stochasticity require the animal to move over larger areas for longer periods of time. This results in a greater uncertainty in how much time and space the animal will require to reach satiety, or indeed whether an animal living in highly stochastic environments can even reach satiety within a finite amount of time.

The remaining panels in figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) illustrate how the effect of $\var(R)$ depends on $\e(R)$ (and vice-versa) as well as how complex the relationships can be. Since $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ have opposite effects on $H$, disentangling the effects can be particularly difficult when both parameters change in a correlated manner (e.g., linear $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$). When both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ increase linearly, $H$ initially increases since the effect of $\var(R)$ is stronger, but then decreases as the effect of $\e(R)$ begins to dominate. However, when $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ follow fairly different trends (e.g., cyclical $\e(R)$ and linear $\var(R)$), it is easy to see how an increase in $\var(R)$ amplifies the effects of $\e(R)$. In contrast, the effect of $\var(R)$ is stronger when $\e(R)$ is low (e.g., linear $\e(R)$ with cyclical $\var(R)$). Thus, $H$ is largest when $\e(R)$ is low and $\var(R)$ is high, and it is smallest when $\e(R)$ is high and $\var(R)$ is low [see the panel with cyclical $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ as well as @lai_movement_2017].

Not all 25 scenarios depicted in figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) may be realistic, but the trends in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, and their impacts on animal space use are useful examples that can be thought of as simplified scenarios. $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ may be assumed to be (approximately) constant in highly homogeneous environments. Although it is impossible for $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ to increase linearly forever, these examples are useful to demonstrate that linear changes in $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ affect $H$ nonlinearly. Cyclical oscillations in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ may occur in urban environments as human activity changes within and between days [@peron_periodic_2017; @ikeda_home_2022] and as temperatures fluctuate daily and seasonally [@geremia_migrating_2019; @alston_temperature_2020], while $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ may drift randomly in highly complex environments which are too hard to predict. Finally, erratic changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ may occur in environments where changes are very sudden, such as areas prone to fires or floods, as well as habitats with drastic human alteration (e.g., a forest which is clear-cut with a subsequent artificial re-forestation). However, if stochastic changes are sufficiently small and frequent, animals may perceive them as continuous and smooth changes rather a series of small and sudden changes.

Although the temporal trends in figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) are complex and the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ can be hard to disentangle, two surprisingly simple relationships emerge when home-range size is shown as a function of either $\e(R)$ or $\var(R)$, rather than time. Both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ affect spatial needs precisely as we hypothesized (figure \@ref(fig:5-5-reg)).<!--, although we found that the effect of $\var(R)$ is closer linear than we expected (it is mostly sub-linear as long as $H$ is sufficiently far from zero). We ensured this was not due to a low maximum $\var(R)$ (as in the left-hand side of figure \@ref(fig:s2-hyp)) by simulating within the range $\sigma^2(t) \in [2\,500, 250\,000] \implies \sigma \in [50, 500]$, since the range of $\e(R)$ was $\mu(t) \in [100, 200]$.--> We believe the approximately linear effect of $\var(R)$ on $H$ is mainly due to two factors. Firstly, $H$ scales superlinearly with the standard deviation in $R$ (as $\sqrt{\var(R)}$ is on the same scale as $\e(R)$; not shown), which would necessarily imply that $H$ increases *sub*linearly with $\var(R)$. Secondly, the animal's movement was simulated to be range resident within an homogeneous environment. Since real-world landscapes are spatially heterogeneous in both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, animals may choose to shift their home range to a new area following a stochastic event that caused $\mu(t)$ to decrease, such as a fire or a flood. Thus, we hypothesize that our simulations may be underestimating animals' responses to spatiotemporal changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, since the simulated animals cannot select for areas of higher $\e(R)$ or lower $\var(R)$. Additionally, the simulations also ignore how competition, movement costs, predation, and other factors may affect the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on $H$. While these are definitely important effects that should be accounted for [@jetz_scaling_2004], doing so was beyond the scope of this paper.

# Applying the framework

\noindent In this section, we show how this framework can be applied to better understand the movement ecology of free-ranging animals via remote sensing data such as NDVI [@pettorelli_normalized_2011]. To illustrate the methods, we use empirical tracking data on a lowland tapir from the Brazilian Cerrado. Appendix 2 contains additional information on how NDVI was modeled along with details on the continuous-time movement models [@fleming_ctmm_2021; @noonan_scale-insensitive_2019] and autocorrelated kernel density estimation [@noonan_comprehensive_2019; @alston_mitigating_2022; @silva_autocorrelationinformed_2022] used to quantify the tapir's spatial needs.

The hypotheses we present here allow researchers to combine otherwise complicated findings (e.g., figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims)) and generalize results to a single, common set of functions. We expect the two hypotheses we present here (figures \@ref(fig:mu-hyp) and \@ref(fig:s2-hyp)) to be applicable to all motile organisms, once differences in size, metabolic needs, and diet are accounted for. In this subsection, we illustrate how researchers can leverage these hypotheses using their own data to build on previous work rather than listing the results as new findings. Additionally, the analyses can be expanded to the population or species level with the use of Hierarchical Generalized Additive Models (HGAMs) with individual-level intercepts and smooth terms [see models "GS" and "GI" in @pedersen_hierarchical_2019]. Such models would allow one to test whether members of the same population or species respond similarly to $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ while also quantifying any deviation from the hypothesized behavior. Individuals and populations that were once thought to have different spatial needs due to differences in behavior may instead be simply responding to different local conditions along the functions in figures \@ref(fig:mu-hyp) and \@ref(fig:s2-hyp) [e.g., @singh_migration_2012]. In the following sections, we illustrate how one can apply this framework to empirical data.

We start by providing examples and considerations on how one may model $R$ and the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on animals' spatial needs. Next, we apply the methods to the tapir's GPS tracking data and use NDVI as a proxy for $R$. Finally, we offer suggestions on how this approach can be used to inform conservation-related decisions, including assessing habitat quality and estimating animals' spatial needs under different scenarios.

### Modeling $R$

\noindent Location-scale models [@stasinopoulos_generalized_2007; @rigby_generalized_2005] are a class of statistical models that allow us to estimate changes in a random variable's mean (i.e. its location) and variance (which depends on its scale) while allowing the mean-variance relationship to vary. `mgcv` [@wood_generalized_2017] is a commonly used package for `R` [@r_core_team_r_2022] that allows one to fit Generalized Linear Models [GLMs, see @zuur_mixed_2009] and Generalized Additive Models [GAMs, see @wood_generalized_2017], including hierarchical and location-scale GLMs and GAMs. Currently, the `mgcv` package allows one to fit location-scale models with various families of distributions, including Gaussian (i.e., normal), gamma, and Tweedie location-scale families (see the help on `?mgcv::family.mgcv` and `?mgcv::twlss` for more information).

The Gaussian location-scale family of distributions is very flexible, since the mean and variance parameters are assumed to be independent, and the response can be either positive or negative. However, the distribution's flexibility can also result in unreliable estimates for non-Gaussian responses, such as strictly positive data (e.g. available biomass), count data (e.g., number of prey), proportions (e.g., percentage of forested habitat), and bounded ratios [e.g., NDVI, see @pettorelli_normalized_2011].

The Gamma location-scale family is best for strictly positive responses, such as areas (including home ranges), elemental compositions [e.g., carbon to nitrogen ratio, see @rizzuto_forage_2021], total biomass<!-- (e.g., kg of carbon per m$^2$)-->, or energetic intake<!-- (e.g., kcal/day)-->. The Tweedie location-scale family is similar to the Gamma family, but it allows for zero data, so it is appropriate for data with a non-trivial amount of zeros, such as daily precipitation or prey density [but see zero-inflated distributions: @zuur_zero-truncated_2009]. In this paper, we estimate $R$ by modeling NDVI using `mgcv` and a beta location-scale family (not available in `mgcv` at the time of publication). If one is interested in families of distributions which are not available in `mgcv`, we suggest using the `brms` package [@burkner_brms_2017], which allows full control over all of a family's parameters via a fully Bayesian approach [as opposed to `mgcv`'s Empirical Bayes method -- see @burkner_advanced_2018].

Modeling the mean and variance terms of $R$ should be done carefully. Since trends in both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ can be spatiotemporally nonlinear and non-monotonic, we suggest using a GAM rather than a GLM. However, the complexity of the spatiotemporal terms should be chosen carefully, particularly for the mean's terms. An excessively wiggly $\hat \mu(t)$ will cause $\sigma^2(t)$ to be under-estimated, while an excessively smooth $\hat \mu(t)$ will cause $\sigma^2(t)$ to be over-estimated. Although there is no error-proof system, choosing the complexity of the terms based on the animal's ability to detect change and adapt is a reasonable starting point. Additionally, setting the basis dimension (`k`) of the scale terms to be half or less than that of the mean terms and using restricted marginal likelihood [@wood_fast_2011] should provide reasonably accurate results. We suggest starting with low values of `k` and adjusting `k` based on the trends in the residuals. Note that since $R$ is likely spatiotemporally autocorrelated, it may be easy to overfit the model. @simpson_modelling_2018 provides a useful introduction to GAMs for biological time series.

### Estimating $R$ using NDVI

\noindent Since there is no commonly-used distribution with a support over the interval $[-1, 1]$, we use beta distribution after scaling NDVI to the interval $[0, 1]$ by applying the **linear transformation**

\begin{equation}
\nu_{[0, 1]} = \frac{\nu + 1}{2},
(\#eq:ndvi-to-01)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\nu$ indicates the NDVI value in $[-1, 1]$ and $\nu_{[0, 1]}$ is the scaled NDVI value [see @denny_fallacy_2017 for more information on transforming response data]. <!--Note that only **linear transformations** (i.e. only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) should be applied to random variables to avoid biases while estimating the distribution and its parameters [@denny_fallacy_2017; @jensen_sur_1906; @ohara_not_2010].--> In this case, we can define $R$ as following a beta distribution with mean and variance that depend on time using the notation $B (\mu(t), \sigma^2(t))$. We use this parameterization here for ease of explanation, but note that beta distributions are generally parameterized using the shape parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that the mean is

\begin{equation}
\e(R) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}
(\#eq:beta-mean)
\end{equation}

\noindent while the variance is

\begin{equation}
\var(R) = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta+1)}.
(\#eq:beta-var)
\end{equation}

\noindent We can easily convert $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ back to mean and variance in NDVI using the inverse of equation \@ref(eq:ndvi-to-01):

\begin{equation}
\nu = 2 \nu_{[0, 1]} - 1.
(\#eq:01-to-ndvi)
\end{equation}

\noindent Consequently, we have

\begin{equation}
\e(\nu|t) = 2 \mu(t) - 1.
(\#eq:mu-to-e-ndvi)
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\var(\nu|t) = 2^2 \sigma^2(t) + 0 = 4 \sigma^2(t).
(\#eq:sigma2-to-v-ndvi)
\end{equation}

\noindent Particular attention should be be given when deciding what distribution to use and how to estimate means and variances in $R$. Improper models and simulations of resource abundance can fail to produce robust, sensible, and accurate estimates of $R$.

<!--
## Animal movement as a stochastic process

### Drivers of animal movement

\noindent @nathan_movement_2008 suggested we can generalize animal movement from location $\vec l_t$ to location $\vec l_{t+1}$ using the model

\begin{equation}
\vec l_{t+1} = F(\Omega, \Phi, \vec w_t, \vec l_t, \vec \xi_t),
(\#eq:nathan-movement)
\end{equation}

\noindent such that an animal's position as time $t+1$ depends on its motion capacity ($\Omega$), navigation capacity ($\Phi$), internal state ($\vec w_t$) and current location ($\vec l_t$), as well as how each of the parameters may change in response to the current environmental factors ($\vec \xi_t$). This model is conceptually useful, as it can form the basis for many models, experiments, and hypotheses, but fitting such a model would be very difficult in practice (if not impossible). The parameters $\Omega, \Phi, \vec w_t$ and $\vec \xi_t$ cannot be quantified directly, and although it may be possible to monitor proxies for the parameters (e.g., limb length, body size, site fidelity, cortisol levels, reproductive stage), doing so with sufficient frequency and accuracy would not be simple. Thus, we can instead focus on animals' movement and spatial needs as a response to overall resource abundance and unpredictability while accepting other drivers of movement as causes of stochastic behaviors.

### Visualizing movement as a stochastic process

\noindent To understand how movement can be viewed as a **stochastic process**, imagine an animal that leaves its den or nest to collect resources and returns to it once it has collected enough resources for the day. If we do not know why the animal is choosing to move in one direction or another, nor do we know what the environment is like, we cannot predict where the animal may move from one time point to another. However, we can use the animal's positional data to estimate the amount of time it spends collecting resources before returning "home" (or the time required for the position to "decay" back to the average position). This period is often referred to as the **range crossing time** or the positional autocorrelation parameter, $\tau_p$. Similarly, we can define $\tau_v$ to be the amount of time the animal moves with the same direction and speed, or the time required for an animal's velocity to "decay" back to the average velocity, $\e(v)$, estimated by $\widehat{\e(v)} = \bar v$. $\tau_v$ is referred to the animal's **directional persistence** or the velocity autocorrelation parameter.

By modeling movement via stochastic models which account for autocorrelation in position [e.g., Ornstein–Uhlenbeck or OU models, see @uhlenbeck_theory_1930] and autocorrelation in velocity [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Foraging or OUF models, see @fleming_fine-scale_2014], one is able to account for and leverage autocorrelation in tracking data. While autocorrelation is problematic for models that assume locations to be independent, modeling movement as a stochastic, autocorrelated process avoids systematic biases in the estimation of home ranges [@noonan_comprehensive_2019] as well as travelling distances and speeds [@noonan_scale-insensitive_2019].

Accurate speed estimates require the **sampling interval**, $\Delta t$, to be sufficiently small [$\Delta t < \tau_v$, see @noonan_scale-insensitive_2019], since the data must contain multiple consecutive samples where the animal is moving with a similar speed and direction. However, since the time required for an animal to cross its home range is orders of magnitude larger than the time it moves with a consistent behavior (i.e., $\tau_p > \tau_v$), it is still possible to produce good estimates of range crossing time even if there is no information on the animal's speed. Similarly, if the data is too sparse to estimate $\tau_p$, one can still obtain good estimates of the animal's spatial needs and home-range size, provided that the total **sampling duration**, $T$, is sufficiently long. Model selection procedures with criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion [@akaike_new_1974] can help choose the most appropriate model for the available data [@silva_autocorrelationinformed_2022].

Predicting animal movement using stochastic models may seem less straightforward and more complex than using deterministic models, but ignoring the exact causes and decisions that determine the movement allows us to focus on *how* the animal moved and less on *why* it moved. Animals may temporarily change their behavior in response to many causes, including predators [mule deer: @ciuti_effects_2012; shovelnose sturgeon: @hintz_shovelnose_2013; rodents: @randler_predator_2020; macaques: @liu_predator_2022; but also see beaked whales: @siegal_beaked_2022], competitors [Capuchin monkeys: @torrez-herrera_monkeys_2020], weather [framework: @gibert_crossing_2016; giant anteaters: @giroux_role_2022], and mates or mating periods [feral cats: @zhang_home_2022; yellow mongoose: @cronk_home_2021]. Accounting for these causes of variation as a sum of stochastic processes allows us to account for the unpredictability in animal movement while focusing on the animals' movement behaviors rather than the causes.

### Quantifying spatial needs

\noindent The concept of a home range has a long history in ecological research as an indicator of the space an animal requires to satisfy its essential requirements during a period of time [@burt_territoriality_1943], but home range analysis is not appropriate for animals which are not range-resident, such as migrating animals [e.g., @jonzen_rapid_2006; @geremia_migrating_2019; @abrahms_memory_2019] and nomadic animals [e.g., @morato_space_2016; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019]. Although here we quantify animal's spatial needs using 95% home-range estimates, we expect that similar conclusions can be drawn about the positional variance, $\vpos$, of animals that are not range-resident.In the case of animals that are range resident for short periods of time, we can model their movement and short-term spatial needs within distinct and discrete periods or using a sliding window approach (see the discussion section). Note, however, that although range-resident animals will generally have smaller positional variance ($\vpos$) than migratory and nomadic animals, $\vpos$ is not sufficient to distinguish between range residency, migration, and nomadism, since $\vpos$ determines the scale and size of an animal's movement but not its behavior. Instead, the animal's $\tau_p$, $\tau_v$, and $\bar v$ can help discriminate between different behaviors. Animals with a $\tau_p$ shorter than a year are likely range-resident, while animals with a $\tau_p$ on the order of a year are likely to be migratory (as long as their life expectancy is greater than a year). In contrast, when an animal's $\tau_p$ is on the order of its expected lifespan, it is most often nomadic, since it does not have an average position it returns to regularly.

<!-- ### Modeling spatial needs -->

<!-- \noindent Recent improvements in animal tracking technologies (e.g., increasing sampling duration and frequency of GPS units) have allowed scientists to demonstrate that changes in animals movement and behavior may be more common than previously thought [leatherback turtles: @hays_flexible_2006; arctic foxes: @lai_movement_2017; elephants: @foley_severe_2008; bison and mule deer: @geremia_migrating_2019; bald eagles: @wheat_migrate_2017]. However, most commonly used movement models assume animals' behaviors to remain consistent during the entirety of the tracking period [but see behavior-switching state-space models, e.g., @michelot_movehmm_2016]. -->

<!-- To quantify an animal's changes in behavior in response to $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, we suggest using a **sliding window** approach. The width of the window, $w$, should be a fixed value greater than two or three times the animal's expected range crossing time [@fleming_overcoming_2019]. If the animal's spatial use is relatively consistent over time, one may determine $w$ using the value of $\tau_p$ estimated using the whole dataset. Alternatively, if the animal's behavior changes repeatedly (e.g., uses a small area for a short period of time before moving to a new one), then one may want to test multiple values of $w$ to find a value sufficiently large for an effective sample size of at least 2 or 3 range crossings (i.e., $w \gtrapprox 2.5 \,\tau_p$). -->

<!-- Modeling animal movement as a continuous-time stochastic process is particularly useful in this approach, since it accounts for the uncertainty and limited amount of information contained in short periods of (autocorrelated) tracking data by differentiating between the sample size (i.e., the number of locations) and effective sample size [i.e., the number of range crossings, see @noonan_scale-insensitive_2019; @noonan_comprehensive_2019]. In this paper, we model tracking data using continuous-time movement models via the `ctmm` package [@fleming_ctmm_2021] for `R` [@r_core_team_r_2022]. -->

### Modeling the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on animals' spatial needs

\noindent As discussed in the previous section, the first step to modeling $H$ is to choose an appropriate family of distributions. Since $H$ is strictly positive and continuous, a Gamma family seems the most appropriate among the distributions currently offered by the `mgcv` package [@wood_generalized_2017], but the Tweedie family would also be appropriate if the variance does not scale with the squared mean.

As with the simulated effects of $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ on $H$ (figure \@ref(fig:5-5-reg)), a location-scale Gamma model is likely required. If there is not sufficient data to fit a location-scale model (which is not the case here), a simple Gamma model may be sufficient, but we suggest selecting the best family of distributions using an information criterion such as the Akaike Information Criterion [@akaike_new_1974]. Due to potential correlation between $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ in a small and autocorrelated sample, the relationship between $R$ and $H$ should be modeled carefully and with parsimony. To appropriately constrain the shape of the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, we suggest using a GLM or a shape-constrained GAM (as long as the wiggliness of each term is chosen carefully). Here, we model the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on $H$ using a shape-constrained GAM with via the `scam` package [@pya_scam_2022]. Additional information on the model can be found in Appendix 2.

### The effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on a lowland tapir's spatial needs

```{r tapir-mw, fig.cap="Seven-day home-range size of a lowland tapir (\\emph{Tapirus terrestris}) in response to changes in mean and variance in resource abundance. (a.)

```

\noindent Figure \@ref(fig:tapir-mw) illustrates  the tapir's response to changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$. Panels **a** and **b** show the changes in mean and variance in NDVI, respectively, during the tracking period. Panel **c** shows the changes in the tapir's space use over time. Note how the home-range size is larger during periods of lower NDVI (e.g., August 2017) and smallest during periods with high NDVI (January 2018). In contrast, when resources are scarce and highly unpredictable (August 2018), the tapir uses up to 5 times more space than when resources are abundant and predictable (January 2018). Finally, panels **d** and **e** show the estimated (partial) effects of $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$ on the tapir's space use. Again, the estimated effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ follow the simple relationships we hypothesized (figures \@ref(fig:mu-hyp) and \@ref(fig:s2-hyp)) and supported with the simulated responses (figure \@ref(fig:5-5-reg)). Thus, while the time series shown in panel **c** may appear complicated, the tapir's response can be well described by two simple functions.

# Discussion

<!-- \noindent This paper presents a unifying framework for describing the effects of resource abundance and stochasticity on animals' spatial needs. The hypotheses and methods we present allow researchers to generalize the effects $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ have on animals' spatial needs by building upon previous work rather than stating their results as new findings. -->

## Animal adaptations to changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$

\noindent The spatiotemporal scale over which an event occurs is a main determinant of whether an animal will be able to predict the event and how it will respond to it (or fail to do so). Events that occur at the scale of the organism [i.e. approximately one or more times per generation and on the spatial scale of the animal's spatial range, see @frankham_importance_2004] are more likely to be perceived as a threat or boon worth preparing for [@foley_severe_2008; @berger_climate_2018; @geremia_migrating_2019]. Consequently, organisms with long generations (e.g., elephants, *Loxodonta sp.*) or large spatial ranges (e.g., migratory birds) are more likely to experience stochastic events and thus are also more likely to respond to and prepare for them. Animals may adapt by adjusting the timing of reproduction [@southwood_habitat_1977; @boersma_wildfire_2021] and torpor or hibernation [@inouye_climate_2000; @goldberg_hibernation_2021], or storing large amounts of energy [@lindstedt_seasonality_1985] through fat storage [@armitage_energetics_2003; @nespolo_why_2022] or resource caching [@post_caching_2006]. Alternatively, animals may alter their movement and travel long distances over short periods of time [@jetz_scaling_2004; @hirt_general_2017], whether this be for migration [@geremia_migrating_2019; @mueller_social_2013] or nomadism [@teitelbaum_how_2015; @teitelbaum_beyond_2019; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019]. Over the years, animals may also develop more complex cognitive abilities [@brown_toward_2004], including the development of memory [@fagan_spatial_2013; @riotte-lambert_environmental_2020; @steixner-kumar_strategies_2020; @geremia_migrating_2019; @abrahms_memory_2019; @cavedon_genomic_2022; @foley_severe_2008; @polansky_elucidating_2015; @falcon-cortes_hierarchical_2021; @rickbeil_plasticity_2019; @ranc_memory_2022], which is required for migration [@mueller_social_2013; @geremia_migrating_2019; @merkle_spatial_2019; @abrahms_memory_2019; @rickbeil_plasticity_2019; @middleton_green-wave_2018; but see: @cuadrado_assessing_2021; @stefanescu_timing_2021].

However, adapting to changes in environmental cues rather than relying on memory alone [@severson_spring_2021; @rickbeil_plasticity_2019; @buntgen_elevational_2017; @jonzen_rapid_2006], can prevent animals from becoming trapped in sub-optimal conditions [@abrahms_memory_2019].

In contrast, individuals with short lifespans are less likely to experience stochastic events and develop memory about them. However, the short generation time and high reproductive rate of r-selected species [as opposed to k-selected species, see @pianka_r-_1970; @brown_toward_2004] may promote other traits that increase survival following extreme events. Examples include higher population size, dispersal, higher genetic diversity, and complex group dynamics [e.g., @cuadrado_assessing_2021; @stefanescu_timing_2021]. Events that occur over large spatiotemporal scales can thus promote slow, large-scale changes through the adaptation, natural selection, and evolution of the species [@grant_evolution_2017; @logares_black_2012; @anderson_black-swan_2017; @gienapp_climate_2008], which is more likely to adapt if starting populations are large with high genetic diversity and short generations, as in the case of r-selected species [but see @leung_smaller_2022]. Of course, an animal with a lifespan shorter than a year will be unable to experience the cyclical nature of the seasons, and an animal with a lifespan of a few weeks or days may not even experience substantial changes in weather other than daily cycles and some weather stochasticity. Still, a population may respond to spatiotemporal cycles in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ by adapting the group's reproduction timing and migration [e.g., painted lady butterflies: @cuadrado_assessing_2021; @stefanescu_timing_2021].

A population's fitness and chances of survival in a changing environment depend strongly on its adaptability and responsiveness to change [@riotte-lambert_environmental_2020], and its ability to recognize cues that precede extreme events or periods of scarcity or abundance can have appreciable effects on its members' chances of survival and reproduction. For example, ungulates' ability to time their yearly migrations on available forage biomass, snow fall, snow melt, and hunting pressure allow them to adapt to changes in both $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, while their spatial memory [@falcon-cortes_hierarchical_2021; @ranc_memory_2022] allows them to optimize their large-scale movement by reducing the amount of time and energy spent exploring. Similarly, the ability of trans-Saharan migrant birds to adapt their migration timing based on environmental cues allows them to account for differences in $\mu(t)$ between years [@jonzen_rapid_2006]. However, relying too strongly on short-term changes rather than depending on long-term memory can also cause animals to fail to find crucial resources during unpredictable times [whooping cranes: @mueller_social_2013; elephants: @polansky_elucidating_2015; @foley_severe_2008; whales: @abrahms_memory_2019]. Instead, if anomalies occur repeatedly over time, animals may adapt to a higher $\sigma^2(t)$ or shift their ranges altogether [terrestrial animals: @chen_rapid_2011; ungulates: @severson_spring_2021; @buntgen_elevational_2017], including migratory animals [@jonzen_rapid_2006]. Still, while range shifts can help species overcome changes in the long-term trends in $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma^2(t)$, including changes in phenology [@severson_spring_2021], they can also result in phenological mismatches [@lameris_arctic_2018] and add pressure to the species that already live in the habitat [e.g., @wallingford_adjusting_2020; but see @shepard_predators_2022], including specialists and obligate symbionts that may be unable to shift their range, since it is determined by their food sources' and associates' ability to move and adapt, too.

## Applications for conservation

\noindent Technical advancements from the last few decades have allowed scientists to collect increasingly larger amounts of data at finer and finer scales [@nathan_big-data_2022], but little attention has been paid to estimating the effects of environmental stochasticity on animal behavior. In these times of great change and climatic uncertainty [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023; @abrahms_human-wildlife_2021], it is increasingly important to recognize how environmental stochasticity affects animal behavior and shapes ecosystems. Accounting for changes in both resource abundance and resource stochasticity is crucial when assessing whether the quality of protected areas is sufficiently high to sustain biodiversity long term. Protecting areas with high resource abundance and low resource stochasticity will reduce animal's spatial requirements.

The designation of high-quality habitats is a central concern of many conservation initiatives. This framework allows consultants and conservation managers to quantify the quality of a habitat based on its resource abundance and stochasticity as well as the amount of space animals would need in the habitat. With the methods presented in this paper, one can (1) assess the quality of current protected areas, (2) predict whether or not the areas will be able to sustain current populations in future decades, and (3) evaluate the quality of new potential conservation areas. In light of the UN's objective to conserve 30% of global landmasses and waters by 2030 [@ipbes_global_2019], the framework and methods presented here provide useful metrics for evaluating whether protected areas will have sufficient quality and long-term stability to support species under various possible climate change scenarios [@intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023].

Ignoring the effects of recent and predicted increases in $\var(R)$, including an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events [@yao_emergence_2022; @intergovernmental_panel_on_climate_change_climate_2023], has the potential to greatly hinder future conservation efforts. Since not accounting for an increase in $\sigma^2(t)$ will result in an under-estimation of animals' spatial needs, protected areas which were designated based on the area's $\mu(t)$ but not $\sigma^2(t)$ will likely be insufficient in both size and resources in the future, which may lead to decreases in the fitness and size of a population while also increasing the risk of population collapse and human-wildlife conflict [@mukeka_human-wildlife_2019]. This is particularly the case in resource-poor, stochastic regions, where animals are forced to endure longer and more unpredictable searches, which results in a larger variance in spatial needs.

It is also worth noting that carnivores may be more susceptible to changes in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$, and that this susceptibility is likely amplified further at higher trophic levels. While primary consumers can rely on relatively predictable and static resources that can be estimated easily via remote sensing measures such as NDVI, the  fine-scale location of secondary consumers' resources may not correlate as strongly with measures of habitat productivity. In fact, primary consumers' ability to move makes their location and abundance more stochastic than those of plants. Consequently, the abundance of primary consumers may correlate with productivity weakly or at a temporal lag [e.g., @geremia_migrating_2019]. Thus, primary consumers' delayed responses to fluctuations in $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ may result in an increase in secondary consumers' resource stochasticity, which would also be perceived with a delay. Similar hypotheses can be formulated for higher trophic levels but with amplified temporal lags, since each trophic level adds another layer of uncertainty and delayed response, which together increase the unpredictability on how carnivores indirectly respond to changes in primary productivity. However, the effect is likely less pronounced for omnivores and other diet generalists, as they may have the ability to switch to more abundant and less stochastic resources.

# Conclusion

\noindent The work presented here provides a unifying framework for viewing animal movement as a function of resource abundance and stochasticity. We provide realistic and flexible hypotheses of the effects of $\e(R)$ and $\var(R)$ on animals' spatial needs and movement behavior. We demonstrate that animals' spatial needs respond nonlinearly to both resource abundance and stochasticity, and we demonstrate the importance of accounting for $\var(R)$ besides $\e(R)$. We also provide a moving window approach that allows one to model animal movement continuously rather than imposing arbitrary thresholds between different periods or types of behaviors, including temporal changes in spatial needs and shifts between range-residency and nomadism. The methods presented here can be applied to assess the current and future quality of protected areas while also estimating the amount of space animals currently need and will need in the future under different climate change scenarios.
